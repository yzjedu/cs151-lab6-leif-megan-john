# Reflection Document

NOTE: I DO NOT HAVE THIS DOCUMENT ENCRYPTED BECAUSE I DISCARDED THE ENCRYPTION KEY AFTER LAB 5 ASSUMING THAT WAS THE LAST TIME WE WOULD USE THEM

In this lab, the objective was to build a program that that would function as an ATM with depositing, withdrawels, and balance viewing via defined functions.
This lab focused on using an existing code to refine a system by simplifying it into defined functions.
We wrote out an algorithm before we did anything, then made a variety of test cases to get a rough outline of the paths we anticipated our code to go down.
After all the pre-emptive stuff was squared away, we got to work on the code, actually managing to create an errorless version on the first go-around.
As such, we got our expected output pretty much immediately, having, as previously mentioned, written the code and comments without error.
In terms of test cases, considering the nature of the program, we did not use any extreme test cases, since we deemed them only relevent for mapping out outcomes.
One issue we encountered in working on this project was trying to get the functions to read variables outside of it's domain.
We solved this problem by using global variables.
Other than that, we did not have any outstanding problems concerning the code that needed addressing.
The most important takeaway I had in this lab was primarily to be careful with how you orient your code.
The main issues we ran into mostly involved unread variables due to functions not being able to read universal objects due to being in their own little box.
This, as previously mentioned, caused a couple of unforseen errors.
Despite this, I think I learned what I was supposed to, because I managed to write a functioning while loop that would cease whenever the exit option was selected.
